<h2>Do You Need Covid Safe Travel Ideas?</h2> 

<h3>Would you like to wake up in a Luxurious Airstream at Russian, River?</h3>


<p>I promised to give you more details about my covid safe trip last week, also I think it may be helpful if you plan to stay somewhere safe along the long weekend. By the way, this is not a sponsored post, I just want to share my experience there.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before that my close friend Ozlem Konan and I decided to make a few days trip to Russian River for her birthday celebration two weeks ago. We were careful and responsibly drove about 1.5 hours to the Russian River, California. We stayed at <a href="https://autocamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Autocamp</a> which located in a grove of native Redwood trees. Property surrounded by a fence and a secure gate. It was a contactless check-in and check-out. There are luxurious canvas tents and Airstreams that all suites outfitted with luxurious bedding, linens and towels. Each of them their own private deck, campfire, and seats. Airstreams have 4 people of family capacity. They allow dogs at Airstreams. They have a shop that you can buy snacks, wine & beer, or camping essentials at their Mid-century modern architectural clubhouse.
Their location is perfect for walking or riding a bike to the River and downtown Guerneville. Also great location to hike in the Redwoods. </p>

<p class="cen">Hope this quick information helps, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me, if you have any questions about our stay. </p>
