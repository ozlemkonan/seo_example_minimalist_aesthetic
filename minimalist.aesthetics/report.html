        <h3>Google Analytic Report of The Minimalist Aesthetics</h3>

        <p> My <a href="report/Analytics-Overview.pdf" target="_blank">Google Analytic Report</a> is based on Behavior Overview Report that gives an overview of pageviews, unique pageviews, average time spent on each page, bounce rate and exit rate.</p>


        <p>Total 6,667 pageviews, 3,358 unique pageviews between August 30 – September 20, 2020. I have posted my website’ URL on a Facebook group September 2nd and that has been provided visitors from all over the world. Social Marketing is always get more visitors webpages so I've decided to go deeper Social Media Marketing for getting more pageviews. And of course being carreful about always up to date.</p>
        
        <p>There are not enough content on the webpages, but there are used lots of attracted images with external links and icon with external links, so, 1,12 % visitors used the external links that goes to blogger’s Instagram posts or to email her. And also last page contact page gets only 13,05% traffics. In regard to all of those interactive parts, visitors are okay being interactive. Average time on page is 21 seconds that needs to support with content and more images. Although the poor content, the bounce rate is 15,81% that is not very high that means 15,81% viewers only view a single page than not look at other pages. My goal is that using add more content with well-chosen keywords and internal and external hyperlinks for making visitors stay longer in the webpages. </p>
